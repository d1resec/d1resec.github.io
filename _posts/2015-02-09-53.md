The first anomaly I will cover is steganography. We are provided a JPG and a description of what needs to be done.

&#8220;A message is hidden in the attached file. Decode the message and submit the message. For partial points, research how the message could have been encoded in the picture and submit the results of your research.

[Hint: steganography]&#8221;

Source [here](http://nwalsh.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pic.jpg). It is a beautiful scenery with mountains and trees! However due to the description, we can be sure that there is something hidden here.

The next step is to obtain a tool that can find steganography and try that before attempting to view everything manually. Fortunately, there is a tool <a title="stegdetect" href="https://github.com/abeluck/stegdetect" target="_blank">stegdetect</a> that we can install on a Linux machine to run just what we need.

There are installation instructions in the git page but I ran into some trouble. The first error I received was when I ran the `make` command.  Specifically <a href="https://github.com/abeluck/stegdetect/issues/2" target="_blank">this</a> error, which tries to use a file that is not there. To fix this I navigated to <a href="https://github.com/file/file/blob/master/magic/Magdir/varied.out" target="_blank">this</a> page where the source for the file is, copied that file and put it in the `stegdetect/file` directory. With that fixed, running `make` again I received another error as the make file could not put a file into `/usr/local/man/man1` directory. This was solved by running the command `mkdir -p /usr/local/man/man1`. Then the `make` command successfully installed stegdetect. With all that work done, we might be able to see the information hidden in the image.

We will use the `steghide` tool (installed with `stegdetect`) to be able to determine the hidden data in the image. We will run the command `steghide extract -sf pic.jpg`.

We are then prompted for a passphrase as all steganography will be encoded with that specific passphrase. A good possibility is something to do with the competition, and it turns out that this specific passphrase is `cdc`. However if you do not know the passphrase it is always possible to write a brute force to try all combinations and &#8216;cdc&#8217; will be found relatively early in comparison to other words. Alternatively, `stegbreak` might be able to find a passphrase that works if the passphrase is in the dictionary file, but I was having trouble installing the software.

Looking at the extraction that `steghide` gave us, we can see a small text file with random letters and numbers, which leads us to believe that the file is encrypted.

By looking at the output we can rule out a few encryption algorithms as this one contains all ASCII characters. Next, we take the output and run it against many decoders (can be found and easily used online) until we can get something tangible. As it turns out, this base64 text is lorem ipsum, which we can decode using a website like [this](https://www.base64encode.org/enc/crack/). Here is the output.

We are now finished with this anomaly!
